        <b>Information We Collect: </b> <br />

        <b>User-provided Information.</b> When you use the Service, we may collect information about you, including your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, your
        date of birth, geographic area, or preferences and we may link this information with other information about you. You may provide us with information in various ways on the
        Service. For example, you provide us with information when you register for an account, use the Service, make a purchase on the Service, or send us customer service-related
        requests.We may also collect and use the information that you will provide to us in connection with a job opening or a general enquiry regarding employment opportunities
        with us, for instance information included in your CV, resume or other details of your employment history.
      </p>

      <p><b>Cookies and Automatically Collected Information.</b></p>
      <p>
        When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session
        cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your
        browser on subsequent visits to the Service. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you
        delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.We may also automatically
        record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may
        include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use our website,
        and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the site. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages,
        such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users and may be connected with other information about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Location Information.</b> We may obtain information about your physical location, such as geolocation features in your device, or by inference from other information we
        collect (for example, your IP address indicates the general geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons. </b> We may display third-party content on the Site, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use
        cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third-party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third
        party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through
        third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Anzio Systems. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to
        that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
      </p>
      <p><b> Information from Other Sources. </b> We may obtain information from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners and advertisers.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          We may use cookies and automatically collected information to: (i) personalize our Service, such as remembering information about you so that you will not have to

        <li>
          We work with third party advertising partners to show you ads that we think may interest you. Some of our advertising partners are members of the Network Advertising

          rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others.
        </li>

          Information about our users may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of
          assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of
          our business assets.
        </li>
        <li>
          We may make certain aggregated, automatically-collected, or otherwise non-personal information available to third parties for various purposes, including: (i) compliance

        </li>
        <li>
          Retention of Personal Information We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is
