        This is a tool to manage your development team. Nothing more, nothing less. <br />

        This is a tool for senior managers, who would like to keep their hand on the pulse. It is not about the micromanagement but getting the heat map of the team. Knowing what
        is happening on the shop floor. <br />

        The senior manager gets the high-level view, and if needed they can quickly drill down. First level manager, Leads can have a more zoomed-in view. <br />
      </p>
      <h3 class="bnr-para">This tool covers the whole spectrum from first-level managers to senior Director, VP and CTO need.</h3>

      <h3 class="bnr-para bluestyle">
        Second, a big problem solved by this tool is - simplifying status reporting.
      </h3>

      <p class="bnr-para content">
        It is easy to write, add your git PR, Jira Tickets with one click. Every report can be reviewed by managers, rate the work with three checkboxes â€“ Achieved, Exceeded and
        Need Improvement. <br />All the reports are archived and one-click access to all the history within tools, help tremendously with the yearly, half-yearly review process.
        The review process is no more scary time, where managers spend hours preparing for discussion. All the information they need is a click away. Because the manager is forced
        to write their comments and rating every month. Final reviews will have no more surprises.
